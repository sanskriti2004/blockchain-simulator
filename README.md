# MehCoin Mining Simulator ⛏️💰

A **Rust-based blockchain mining simulator** implementing **SHA-256 hashing, proof-of-work (PoW), and a simplified blockchain structure**. This project demonstrates core blockchain principles, including **decentralized ledger management, cryptographic hashing, and transaction validation**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mining**: Implements a mining algorithm that requires solving computational puzzles.
- **Blockchain Structure**: Blocks are linked via cryptographic hashes, ensuring immutability.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Used for secure block validation and transaction integrity.
- **Multi-threaded Simulation**: Simulates mining difficulty and delays to mimic real-world blockchain behavior.
- **Chrono Timestamping**: Each block is time-stamped for accurate tracking.
- **Automated Transaction Processing**: Simulated transactions between predefined traders.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🦀 **Rust** (Safe, fast, and memory-efficient programming)
- 🔐 **SHA-256 (sha2 crate)** (Cryptographic hashing)
- ⏳ **Chrono** (Time-based functionalities)
- ⚡ **Multi-threading (std::thread)** (Simulating mining complexity)

## 📜 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sanskriti2004/blockchain-simulator.git
   cd blockchain-simulator
   ```
2. Install Rust (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
3. Run the simulator:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## 🎮 Demo
When you run the program, you'll:
- Enter your miner name.
- Witness blocks being mined with real-time hash calculations.
- See transactions processed between traders.
- Get the total number of blocks mined and MehCoin traded.
### Sample Output:
```
Welcome to the MehCoin mining simulator!
Enter your miner name: Sans
Mining block #1...
Block mined successfully: #1
Transaction: Sans sent MehCoin to Jason

Mining block #2...
Block mined successfully: #2
Transaction: Jason sent MehCoin to Woj

Total blocks mined: 8
Total MehCoin traded: 1096
